File name: Kmeans_task.ipynb

An example of a K-means clustering algorithm, an effective unsupervised machine learning method. Groups data points together without needing target variable(s).

Country-data.csv file must be downloaded and stored in same directory as this ipynb file for the code to execute.

Installations required to run: python3, jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

Simply open in jupyter notebook and run all cells to execute the algorithm.
